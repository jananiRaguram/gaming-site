# React Tech Stack Doc

### Why React 
React is a popular JavaScript library used for developing user interfaces and interactive websites. Here is a little research into its features and why it's a good choice for our project. First of all, React is very simple to set up and get running. Since we are building a game the component-based architecture will help with modularity and lead to code reusability which is also great since we donâ€™t have tons of time to build our game. React's use of a virtual DOM is also a plus since it optimizes rendering efficiency by only updating the elements that need to change on the screen. 

### React Features
1. **Real-time Updates:**
   React's updating makes it well-suited for games.

2. **Component-Based Architecture:**
   React's component-based architecture break down complex game UIs into components.

3. **Virtual DOM:**
   React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates and keep states which is key for making a smooth game.

4. **Ecosystem and Libraries:**
   Since its JS it includes a variety of libraries and tools, especially for game development.


### Alternate Considerations

1. **Unity:**
   - **Language:** C#
   - **Overview:** Unity is game development engine. It supports both 2D and 3D game development and is very popular. Unity also has a large community and tons of game dev assets.

2. **Unreal Engine:**
   - **Language:** C++
   - **Overview:** Unreal Engine is another popular game development engine, and recently is known for its graphics capabilities. 

3. **Phaser:**
   - **Language:** JavaScript
   - **Overview:** Phaser is a lightweight and 2D game framework made for the web. It's used for creating HTML5 games.
