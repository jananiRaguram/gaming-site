# team 10

Over the course of 4 months I contributed to the the creation of this website that hosts games that my team - Team 10 -  came up with. Our team of 6 created 4 puzzle games that are fun to play and get players on their toes. 
To get a better idea of what our games are like head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/jananiRaguram/gaming-site/wiki) that goes over the basics of each game. 

## Our website
 
https://cis4250w24-10.socs.uoguelph.ca/

The creation of the website went through it's ups and downs with the design and what games to include but it is complete. Focusing on classic puzzle games we went through user testing and general unit testing, including checking for accessiblity during development. 

## Files
Our code is organized within the memory game folder and you can check out some of the designs in the designs folder or go over to our [figma](https://www.figma.com/design/VsPTEVoiw7UNqd5lEzhxvW/memory-game?node-id=0-1&t=1L04LjbJqtfiUQDw-1) 

## Testing Outputs

We're using React's testing setup to run front end tests and also accessiblity tests. These tests are done for each push request within our pipeline. While the front end tests can be seen through the pipeline, the accessiblity test results need to be downloaded from the "a11y" job in the build -> artifacts section of gitlab. Downloading the "artifacts.zip" file and opening the html file will allow you to see how accessible the site is based on WCAG2AA standards.
